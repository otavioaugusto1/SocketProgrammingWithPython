	<p> <strong>Jim Kurose </strong>is  a Distinguished University Professor in the <a href="http://www.cs.umass.edu/">College of Information and Computer Sciences</a> at the <a href="http://www.umass.edu/"> University of Massachusetts Amherst</a>, where he has been on the  faculty since receiving his PhD in computer science from Columbia  University. He received a BA in physics from Wesleyan University. He has  held a number of visiting scientist positions in the US and abroad,  including the Sorbonne University, the University of Paris, INRIA, Technicolor, and IBM  Research. He has served in a number of administrative positions at UMass, including Chair of Computer Science, Dean of Natural Sciences and Mathematics, and (currently) Associate Chancellor for Partnerships and Innovation. His research interests include computer network  architecture and protocols, network measurement, sensor networks, and multimedia communication. He is proud to have mentored and taught an amazing group of students, and  to have received a number of awards for his research, teaching and  service, including the IEEE Infocom Award, the ACM SIGCOMM Lifetime  Achievement Award, the ACM Sigcomm Test of Time Award, and the IEEE  Computer Society Taylor Booth Education Medal. With Keith Ross, he is  the co-author of the best-selling textbook, <em>Computer Networking: a Top Down   Approach</em> (Pearson), now in its 8th edition. He is a member of the National Academy of Engineering and a Fellow of the ACM and the IEEE. </p>
